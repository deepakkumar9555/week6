			Engineering is the use of science and math to design or make things. People who do engineering are called engineers. Engineers usually design or build things. Some engineers also use their skills to solve technical problems. There are different types of engineers that design everything from computers and buildings to watches and websites. People have been engineering things for thousands of years.The wide range of disciplines that fall under the engineering title mean that no matter what the prospective student’s interest, there’s bound to be one facet of the sector they’ll find enticing and engaging. Whether its civil, electrical, chemical or mechanical engineering, if you like tinkering, creating, designing or building, the engineering sector has a place for you.

			In an advanced technological world, we need engineers to bring ideas into reality. By applying the principles of mathematics and science, engineers develop solutions to the world’s biggest technical issues. You could find yourself doing anything from building new bridges to developing electrical sockets for refugee camps; working on special effects for blockbuster movies or testing aircraft and aerospace products. With a myriad of positions open to engineers in almost every field, graduates happily welcome the huge choice of careers they have the potential to explore. The engineering portfolio knows no bounds, but these people are all working to the same common goal: building a sustainable world. Whatever you wish to contribute to society through your engineering dedication, nothing compares to the knowledge that you’ve achieved something that’s impacted people’s lives for the better.
